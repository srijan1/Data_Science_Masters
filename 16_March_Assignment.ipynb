    "A1: Overfitting refers to a machine learning model that performs well on the training data but fails to generalize well on new, unseen data. It occurs when the model becomes too complex and learns noise or irrelevant patterns from the training data. The consequence of overfitting is poor performance and high error on unseen data. Underfitting, on the other hand, occurs when the model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The consequence of underfitting is low performance and high bias. Overfitting can be mitigated by techniques like cross-validation, regularization, and feature selection. Underfitting can be mitigated by increasing the model complexity, adding more features, or reducing regularization.\n"

High bias models have a tendency to underfit the data, while high variance models have a tendency to overfit the data.
