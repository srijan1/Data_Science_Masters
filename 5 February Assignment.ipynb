    "Class is a blueprint or a template that defines the structure and behavior of objects in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It encapsulates data and methods that are common to a group of objects. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with its own unique data and behavior. For example, consider a class called \"Car\" that defines the properties (such as color, model, and engine) and methods (such as start, stop, and accelerate). An object of the Car class could be \"myCar,\" which has specific values for its properties and can perform the defined methods."
